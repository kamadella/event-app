# EventApp
The main goal of the project is to develop a web application for searching cultural and entertainment events in the nearby area. Instead of browsing multiple sources for interesting events, users have access to a personalized platform that collects and presents information in an organized and accessible manner. By applying advanced filtering algorithms, the application provides users with events that best match their individual interests, preferences, and current locations. The application has been developed using modern technologies such as Angular and Firebase.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
